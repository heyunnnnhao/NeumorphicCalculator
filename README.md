# Neumorphic Calculator

Neumorphic designed calculator build, using HTML, SCSS and vanilla JavaScript.

I will convert this project into a Vue.js build someday in the future.

Neumorphic is the design trend of 2020, and as a prospect frontend developer, catching up with the design trend is no less important than actual coding.
